With the "Exchange Order" module, quickly manage your exchanged products.
In one interface, select the product to be returned and the product that will replace it,
confirm the exchange, and the module will take care of it all: create the return, generate
a credit and a voucher, and create an order corresponding to the exchange by applying
the voucher and requesting payment of the balance from your client if necessary.
